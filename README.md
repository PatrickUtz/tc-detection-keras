# tc-detection-keras
This is an implementation of Single Shot Detection (SSD) object detection using Keras to detect traffic cones. The original code was taken from pierluigiferrari and can be found here: https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras

A few things to note:

- the only fulling working piece of code is ssd300_training.ipynb which is trained on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 dataset
- ssd300_training-trafficCone.ipynb is the modified version of ssd300_training.ipynb and is meant to work with the traffic cone dataset
- all current issues are marked in the "Issues" section
